  * ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:

	The game is designed to be a version of snakes and ladders with a Mario style theme. The player needs to throw the dice by clicking on it and the character will move through the grid the number of specified places. The bananas act as a snake style obstacle, moving the player back a number of places.

	In designing the game the main issue that I faced was the player movement within the game. In the end the most effectively way to do this was to use a grid type system with block moves right, up or down determined by where the player was in the grid. I have noted below the resources that were extremely helpful in thinking around this topic.
